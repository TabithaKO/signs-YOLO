# signs-YOLO
creating a custom object detector using yolov3 and yolov4

# Instructions
1. Open up the notebook in Google Colab
2. Clone the repo into your colab notebook
3. Move the files into the darknet folder that you will clone within the repo
4. Run the cells sequentially

# Pretrained Weights
The YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 pretrained weights can be downloaded from the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XsyV7PLHGTwTZnFOQf4sTsRefKDbpfXo?usp=sharing)

# Custom Trained Weights
I have my custom trained weights,
- yolov3-custom_2000.weights (YOLOv3)
- yolov4-custom_last.weights (YOLOv4)

feel free to use these weights if you don't want to train your own.

# Demo
I have out.mp4 file in the google drive folder. 
The video is the output from my yolov3 custom weights on a video stream.

# citations:
I borrowed inspiration from various online resources:
- This medium [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/implementing-yolov4-to-detect-custom-objects-using-google-colab-6691c98b15ff)
- The AI Guy's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p44G9_xCM4I&t=1114s)

# Side note:
The notebook isn't as bulky as it seems. I left the output of some of the cells present for you to gauge if you were getting the right output.
